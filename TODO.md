# TODO List for Fixing Footer.jsx, Footer.css, Porduct.jsx, and Product.css

- [x] Fix typos in Footer.jsx: Change "Style Guid" to "Style Guide", "Changlog" to "Changelog", "Intruction" to "Instruction"
- [x] Edit Footer.css: Remove blue backgrounds in media query (.Footer-sec and .col), fix selector from .designer .h3 to .designer h3
- [x] Edit Product.css: Reduce gap in .Product-content from 15rem to 5rem
- [x] Address Porduct.jsx file name misspelling: Note that the file is named Porduct.jsx but component is Product; suggest renaming to Product.jsx (cannot rename directly, so create new file if needed)
- [x] Test the changes by running the app
